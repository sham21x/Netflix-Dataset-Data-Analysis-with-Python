I prepared and cleaned the data by handling null values and incorrect values in the dataset by using Pandas. In Analysis, I answered all the questions related to the dataset like ,Production count by each country or in each year, Movies vs Shows, Best Actor and director â€¦etc. Also visualized the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
